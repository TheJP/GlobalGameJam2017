# Rock The Wave - GlobalGameJam2017
Oh Noes! The evil furries have stolen the patch of land you call home. Together with your rocky friends, you must fend off waves upon waves of these adorable villains. 

Choose one of the ancient shock wave techniques and repel the cute invaders. Make them fly through the clouds, keep them warm in the lava pits and tickle them with the spiky spikes! They’ll love it and call their friends, so be prepared for even more chubby fluffs. Don’t let them get too close though, stony golems may not handle all those mushy hugs.
